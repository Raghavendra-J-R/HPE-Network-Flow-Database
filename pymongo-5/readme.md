In this week we have been informed to explore YCSB(Yahoo! Cloud Serving benchmark)

Here are my learning from YCSB this week

These are the types of workloads in YCSB

Workload A: Update heavy workload: 50/50% Mix of Reads/Writes

Workload B: Read mostly workload: 95/5% Mix of Reads/Writes

Workload C: Read-only: 100% reads

Workload D: Read the latest workload: More traffic on recent inserts

Workload E: Short ranges: Short range based queries

Workload F: Read-modify-write: Read, modify and update existingÂ records
